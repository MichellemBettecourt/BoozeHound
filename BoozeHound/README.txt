Currently Done:

The app has three initial buttons. Currently we have 2/3 buttons 
working and adding the third should be pretty similar. 

The app can add things to the database, remove them and display them.
This completes the overall functionality of the app.


To be completed:

So far we have it working for 1/3 of the type of liquore. Repeating 
this for the other two liquores is just a matter of copy/pasting and 
changing a few entry feilds. 

Finally, we have to add in the ability to use the camera and take a
 photo for your entries. We also want to make the app more visually
appealing

We are on track to be finished on time.

Description:

BoozeHound is a mobile application with the purpose of rating and
tracking beer, wine, and spirits. Each category of booze has its
own quick add and full add forms, as well as its own database
page for viewing, searching, and filtering the results of previous
entries. BoozeHound also includes the capability taking photos of
your bevarages and storing them directly in the app.


How to use:

Upon launching BoozeHound, a main menu screen will be loaded. From
here, all of the features can be accessed. Quick Add provides the
user with a condensed form for the selected beverage type for
entries on the fly. The name of the beverage and a rating are 
required fields. Full Add provides the user with a full length form
that allows for more detailed entries, including a field for
additional comments about the beverage. This form also allows the
user to snap a picture of their drink and store it with the rest of
the data. Your Booze allows the user to view, delete, or edit their
previous entries. This page also allows for searching and filtering
of the entry results.


Known issues:

On Android, pressing the phones back button minimizes the app.
